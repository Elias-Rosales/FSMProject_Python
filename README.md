# FSMProject_Python
The main goal for this project is to generate a design and a testbench Verilog files from a text file describing a finite state machine (FSM), in both Python and C++ languages. The program, in summarize, extracts the information needed from the text file to fill both templates of a design and a testbench file. The output files generated are designed and adapted to be simulated in EDA Playground environment.
